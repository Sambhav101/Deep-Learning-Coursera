The repository features all the labs and projects completed during the Deep Learning Course by Andrew NG in Coursera. The projects involve building complete neural networks with one or more hidden layers from scratch using vectorization and various mathematical functions. The projects deeply focused on training dataset by initializing parameters, feedforward propagation, computing loss, backward propagation, and evaluation. 

Libraries used: Numpy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Sklearn, PIL, 

## Notebooks:

### Lab 0: Python Basics with Numpy

This lab focused on basic numpy functions and using numpy for deep learning functions like softmax, sigmoid etc. Furthermore, Concepts regarding vectorization, broadcasting and normalizing and reshaping images using numpy library were also explored.

### Lab 1: Logistic Regression with Neural Network Mindset

In this lab, I built a logistic regression model that identifies the cat and non-cat picture. The logistic regression model was built from scratch using the neural network architecture with one input layer and one output layer. No hidden layers were implemented. The highest test accuracy obtained was 70%.


### Lab 2: Planar Data Classification with One Hidden Layer

In this lab, I designed a deep Neural Network with one hidden layer in order to classify red and blue petals of flower. Used Stochastic Gradient Descent method for training neural network. Achieved a test accuracy of 97% compared to logistic regression model with only 47%.


### Lab 3: Building your deep Neural Network: Step by Step

In this lab, I used different functions for building deep neural network with mulitple hidden layers. More focused in forward propagation and caching through mulitple hidden layers and backpropagation to calculate gradients and updating weights and parameters. 


### Lab 4: Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application

In this lab, I built a deep neural network with multiple hidden layers from end to end and applied it to image classification of cat and non-cat picture. In the end, the neural network was successfully able to identify a cat picture.
